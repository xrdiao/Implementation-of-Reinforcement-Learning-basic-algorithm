# Reinforcement learning basic algorithm implementation

This document includes **Q_learning, Sarsa, DQN, DDQN, Dueling DQN,  PG, VPG, PPO_Penalty, PPO_Clip, DDPG**. You may find that all classes inherit DQN (except Q-learning and Sarsa). This is because they have the same structure and differ in the training details. Let's enjoy ourselves.

run `python test.py` to train and test the algorithm. 

run `conda env create -f environment.yaml` to install the virtual environment
